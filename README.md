# kotlin-miniprojects

This repository contains a bunch of beginner-level Kotlin miniprojects:
 1. Tic-tac-toe - pretty self-explanatory
 2. Smart calculator - a calculator program that evaluates an expression typed by the user. It supports the four 
 basic operators and the use of variables,
 3. Watermatk - it allows to add a watermark to the image. If the watermark image does not have an alpha channel, 
 the user might choose a color to be treated as transparent. Watermark may be positioned in a grid or in a given position.
 4. Hidden image message - it allows to encode and decode a secret message in an image.  
 5. Flashards - it allows to create flashcards and perform a guessing session. The cards may be imported or exported both
 during the program's execution or with CLI arguments `-import <file name>` and `-export <file name>`
